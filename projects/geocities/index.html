            <p>"Euphoria," an American adaptation of the Israeli drama of the same name, chronicles the tumultuous life of 17-year-old Rue, a drug addict who has no intention of staying clean after rehab. Jules, a transgender teen searching for her place in the world; Nate, a jock whose anger issues mask sexual insecurities; Chris, a football star who finds the transition from high school to college more difficult than expected; Cassie, whose sexual history continues to haunt her; and Kat, a body-conscious teen exploring her sexuality are all in Rue's orbit. The series tackles the teenage landscape of substance-enhanced parties and anxiety-ridden day-to-day living with empathy and candor as the classmates strive to make sense of their futures.</p>

            <p>"My All" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey from her sixth studio album, Butterfly (1997). It was released as the album's fifth single overall and second commercial single on March 24, 1998, by Columbia Records. The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. "My All" is built around Latin guitar chord melodies, and makes subtle use of Latin percussion throughout the first chorus, before taking on a more conventional R&B-style beat. Carey was inspired to write the song and use Latin inspired melodies after her trip to Puerto Rico, where she was influenced by the culture. The song's lyrics tell of a lonely woman declaring she would give "her all" to have just one more night with her estranged lover. It is the first song Carey wrote for the Butterfly album.
