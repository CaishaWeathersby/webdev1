            <h3>Show Description</h3>
            <p>"Euphoria," an American adaptation of the Israeli drama of the same name, chronicles the tumultuous life of 17-year-old Rue, a drug addict who has no intention of staying clean after rehab. Jules, a transgender teen searching for her place in the world; Nate, a jock whose anger issues mask sexual insecurities; Chris, a football star who finds the transition from high school to college more difficult than expected; Cassie, whose sexual history continues to haunt her; and Kat, a body-conscious teen exploring her sexuality are all in Rue's orbit. The series tackles the teenage landscape of substance-enhanced parties and anxiety-ridden day-to-day living with empathy and candor as the classmates strive to make sense of their futures.</p>
